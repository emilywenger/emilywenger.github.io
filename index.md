I research security and privacy issues related to machine learning models. In 2023-2024, I am working as a research scientist at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/" target="_blank">Meta AI</a>, developing machine-learning based attacks on post-quantum cryptosystems. Starting in July 2024, I will be an assistant professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University.

In 2022, I graduated with my PhD from the University of Chicago, where I worked in the <a href="http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">SAND Lab</a> and was advised by <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/" target= "_blank">Ben Zhao</a> and <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng/" target="_blank">Heather Zheng</a>. During my PhD, I received the <a href="https://stemfellowships.org/" target="_blank">GFSD</a>, <a href="https://msfdn.org/harveyfellows/overview/" target="_blank">Harvey</a>, and University of Chicago <a href="https://grad.uchicago.edu/fellowships/neubauer-fellows/" target="_blank">Neubauer</a> and <a href="https://physicalsciences.uchicago.edu/news/article/psd-recognizes-nine-students-with-a-william-rainey-harper-dissertation-fellowship-22/" target="_blank">Harper Dissertation</a> fellowships, as well as a <a href="https://www.siebelscholars.com/scholar-profile/3715/" target="_blank">Siebel Scholarship</a>.
