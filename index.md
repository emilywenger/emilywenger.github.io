I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, where I run the <a href="https://arguslab.pratt.duke.edu/" target="_blank">ARGUS Lab</a>. Our lab researches topics related to AI, security, and society.

<p>
I obtained my PhD from the <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a>. My research has been featured by numerous media outlets including CNN, NBC, the New York Times, and the BBC, and has received several awards, including a <a href="https://stemfellowships.org/" target="_blank">GFSD</a> fellowship, <a href="https://www.siebelscholars.com/scholar-profile/3715/" target="_blank">Siebel Scholarship</a>, and the University of Chicago Harper Dissertation award. I was also named to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2024/consumer-technology" target="_blank">2024 Forbes 30 under 30</a> list for my work on Glaze, a tool that protects artists' work from unwanted use in generative AI models.
